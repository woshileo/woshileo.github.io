        <h1 class="welcome-header">Credit Card Churning Guide</h1>
        <h2 class="welcome-header">Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am writing this guide in hopes of introducing beginners to the world of credit cards. By entering this hobby, you will be able to travel hack and maximize cash back on your everyday purchases. You may be asking, “What is travel hacking?” Here is the answer to that question: Travel hacking is the art of traveling for free by utilizing credit card sign-up bonuses and rewards.</p>
        
        <p>Wow! That sounds great right? However, you may be wondering if there’s a catch to it. If you’re a responsible credit card user, then no, not at all. However, if you are NOT a responsible credit card user, close this document immediately. Let me explain why you shouldn’t play this game if you suck at managing your credit card expenses:
        Credit card issuers make the bulk of their revenue from charging interest on statement balances. This means that individuals who don’t pay off their balance in full or just pay the minimum required are the biggest cash cows. </p>

        <p>Achieving sign-up bonuses often require you to spend X amount of dollars in a set amount of time. The minimum spend required may be large at times, and because of this it encourages consumers to spend more money. Sometimes consumers dig themselves into a hole that they can’t get out because of this. I will be explaining ways you can meet this minimum spend required (i.e. paying rent), but if you are spending money you wouldn’t have been spending in the first place just to meet this minimum spend requirement, then it really isn’t worth it.
        That’s pretty much it! As long as you don’t do the above, you can successfully play the travel hacking game and explore the world completely free.</p>
        
        <p>So, if you’re ready to jump into the wonderful world of travel hacking with credit card points and maximizing your cash back, let’s jump into it!</p>

        <h2 class="welcome-header">Rules</h2>
        <p>First and foremost, there are a number of rules that you need to follow when “churning” credit cards. “Churning” is the process of signing up for credit cards, using the sign-up bonuses, then cancelling the card. The reason why there are a variety of rules to follow is because each credit card issuer has their own guidelines when evaluating risk in applicants. Banks generally don’t like to extend too much credit to someone who has irresponsible spending habits. In addition, consumers who are seeking credit multiple times in a short period are also seen as risky. I will go into more details of the aforementioned topics later, but as long as you stick to these rules and follow my recommendations, you should be good to go.</p>
        
        <p>I always recommend people to start with Chase credit cards first, and there are many good reasons for that. Chase credit cards generally offer the best rewards and bonuses in the industry alongside American Express. These two credit card issuers blow the rest of the industry away. In addition, Chase Ultimate Reward (UR) points and Amex Membership Reward (MR) points are some of the most lucrative currencies in the market. With that being said, I would start with Chase over American Express (Amex). This is because of Chase’s 5/24 rule, and also because of Amex’s once-in-a-lifetime rule.</p>
